# freedive

During the AIDA freediving instructor course I wrote my thesis on the physics of the freefall. The results were interesting and I had ample time on my hands and so I decided to turn this into a web application to calculate and plot the movement and force equations that are releveant during freefall.

The thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/mr-pf/freedive/blob/master/instructor-thesis/freefall.ipynb)

The web-app is currently hosted [here](https://freediving-83da5.web.app/)

The source code consists of the [freefal-solver](https://github.com/mr-pf/freedive/tree/master/freefall-solver ), agoogle cloud function, and the [freefall-frontend](https://github.com/mr-pf/freedive/tree/master/freefall-frontend) written with react.
